But all I\\'m doing this\\nyear is catching up with the daily developments, trying to bring order into\\nchaos to help you (and me) stay on the right side of change.\\n\\nIt feels like we\\'re in the middle of a slow-motion intelligence explosion. The\\nsingularity is here.\\n\\nToday, let\\'s check out the new GPT-4 Turbo release, i.e., more powerful\\nfeatures, a 128k context window (enough to load a 300-paged book into a single\\nprompt) at an API price that\\'s only one-third GPT-4\\'s!\\n\\n[[Blog] GPT-4 Turbo: 12 New Incredible Features at a 3x Reduced Price vs\\nGPT-4]({Link})\\n\\nThink of all the insane apps you can build now! \ud83d\udc47\\n\\nAs a TLDR, here\\'s the brand-new features of _GPT-4 Turbo_ :\\n\\n  * Pricing reduced by a factor of 2-3x\\n  * Context size increased from 8k tokens to 128k tokens\\n  * JSON mode for controlled output of OpenAI Functions (check out [our course]({Link}) on Functions and embeddings)\\n  * Parallel and simultaneous OpenAI Function Calls (again, the [course]({Link}))\\n  * Reproducible outputs and seeds (e.g., to recreate the same image or character in an image for a consistent story)\\n  * Up-to-date world knowledge (cutoff April 2023)\\n  * One ChatGPT interface for all modalities (DALL-E 3, image processing, Plugins, Code Interpreter) without needing to select them in the dropdown\\n  * Acquire knowledge from external (WWW)\\n  * Image input for OpenAI API\\n  * New Text-to-speech generation capabilities (this is insane - the voices are like humans!)\\n  * New speech recognition Whisper 3\\n  * Introducing _GPTs_\\n\\nThe latter is a whole new rabbit hole to explore: You can now easily create\\nyour own flavors of little AI agents that are specialized for certain tasks.\\n\\nHow? With natural language \"programming\", i.e., you tell them what to do using\\nwords not code.\\n\\nThen you can share those agents with the world - the idea is to have an **app\\nstore of AI agents**. And here\\'s the kicker: you\\'ll get a revenue share from\\nOpenAI based on the popularity of your AI agent.\\n\\nThe latter is still a vision but one that\\'s soon be implemented according to\\nSam Altman, founder of OpenAI.\\n\\nLet me repeat this big idea so you don\\'t miss it:\\n\\n**OpenAI creates an app store for specialized user-generated AI agents** to\\nperform any task imaginable that can be integrated into any third-party\\nservice like calendar, banking, email, messaging, social networks,\\nproductivity, e-commerce platforms, ...!\\n\\nAs I said, FOMO is not going to stop soon. All we can do is take one idea at a\\ntime and run with it to see where it takes us. Rinse. Repeat.\\n\\nLet\\'s be on the right side of change! \ud83d\ude80  \\nChris\\n\\n**[How are we doing?]({Link})**  \\n[\u2b50]({Link})  \\n[\u2b50\u2b50]({Link})  \\n[\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50]({Link})  \\n  \\nTo make sure you keep getting these emails, please add _chris@finxter.com_ to\\nyour address book.  \\n  \\nI\\'d love to hear your feedback so that I can improve this free email course\\nover time.

When it identifies that the output does not match the expected result based on the code\u2019s logic, it can deduce the correct answer.\\n  * **Self-Evaluation** : The model exhibits the ability to evaluate its own responses for accuracy, indicating a form of introspection where it can judge its initial response against the logical framework of the Python language.\\n  * **Autonomous Correction** : GPT-4 Turbo can autonomously correct its own mistakes within the context of the single prompt without needing external input, which is indicative of advanced problem-solving capabilities.\\n\\nThis self-reasoning ability is significant because it indicates a level of\\nunderstanding beyond simple pattern matching or retrieval of memorized facts;\\nit shows an ability to engage with the content dynamically and logically\\nconsistently.\\n\\nThis technology really is different and special.

Yes, with Python Async!]({Link})\\n\\nMy main goal with this article is to refresh your understanding of\\n\"asynchronous programming\", one of the hidden superpowers that scales the\\nInternet.\\n\\nSay you\\'re building a chatbot system using OpenAI\\'s API at the backend. How is\\na synchronous versus an asynchronous operation different?\\n\\nIn a synchronous chatbot, when User A asks a question, the system waits for\\nOpenAI\\'s LLM to respond before handling User B\\'s query. If there\\'s a delay for\\nUser A, User B waits, leading to inefficiencies during high traffic.\\n\\nIn an asynchronous setup, the system simultaneously processes User A\\'s and\\nUser B\\'s questions. Both queries are sent to OpenAI\\'s LLM concurrently.\\nResponses are relayed as received, allowing for faster, parallel processing.\\nThis ensures timely answers, regardless of query order or potential delays.\\n\\nThere are many subtleties to it but the simple gist is this: Users often want\\nthat a system feels synchronous but we coders implement it in an asynchronous\\nway so that it scales to not one but many users.\\n\\nYou can copy and paste my code from the new [Finxter blog tutorial]({Link}) to\\ntry asynchronous OpenAI API mode!\\n\\nLet\\'s be on the right side of change! \ud83d\ude80  \\nChris\\n\\n**[How are we doing?]({Link})**  \\n[\u2b50]({Link})  \\n[\u2b50\u2b50]({Link})  \\n[\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50]({Link})  \\n  \\nTo make sure you keep getting these emails, please add _chris@finxter.com_ to\\nyour address book.  \\n  \\nI\\'d love to hear your feedback so that I can improve this free email course\\nover time.

Let\\'s multiply this\\nwith 125% to get the number of tokens output per minute.\\n\\nSo, with our average typing speed, we get about 62.5 tokens/min as coders, or\\n3,750 tokens/hr.\\n\\n$53 per hour divided by 3,750 tokens per hour equates to a cost of about\\n$0.01413 per token for a human coder. \ud83d\udcb0\\n\\n**LLM Coder Costs Per Token:**\\n\\nNow, let\\'s compare this with the cost of a large language model, which is\\nestimated at $0.06 per 1000 tokens (GPT-4-32k)\\n\\nSimple math shows us that this is roughly $0.00006 per token.\\n\\n**That\\'s how much difference?**  \\n\ud83d\udc47\\n\\nSo, if we do a rough comparison, a human coder is about 235 times more\\nexpensive than the language model ($0.01413 / $0.00006 \u2248 235)!\\n\\n235x (!)\\n\\nThat\\'s a significant cost difference! \ud83d\udcb8\\n\\n**Not all is lost though.**\\n\\nProgrammers do more than write code - they design, debug, and communicate.\\n\\nMost importantly, they _engineer prompts_.\\n\\nWhen I realized this napkin math, it became apparent to me that we need to\\npivot as coders.

The first\\nsentence of my [thesis]({Link}):\\n\\n_\"Graphs are fundamental data structures in computer science. Wide-spread\\ndigitization generates massive amounts of interconnected, graph-structured\\ndata [...]\"_\\n\\nLet\\'s have a look at some real-world graphs:\\n\\n  * In **social media** platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, WhatsApp, and Reddit, the \\'nodes\\' represent individual users, while the \\'edges\\' represent the connections between them, like friendships, follows, or likes.\\n  * In **neural networks** , like the one used in Tesla\\'s Full Self-Driving (FSD) system, the \\'nodes\\' represent neurons (or processing units), and the \\'edges\\' represent the weights or synapses, which are the connections between these neurons.\\n  * For the **Internet** , the \\'nodes\\' represent individual web pages, and the \\'edges\\' represent the hyperlinks that connect these web pages to each other.\\n\\nYou can also model financial networks like Bitcoin, Ethereum, or the USD in\\ngraph data structures.\\n\\n**But why should you care?**\\n\\nWell, understanding graph properties is not only a crucial skill of _computer\\nscientists_ (as opposed to _coders_ ), it can make you a lot of money in\\ninvesting and business too. \ud83d\udc47\\n\\nAn exciting characteristic of graph-structured systems are **network\\neffects**. In particular **Metcalfe\\'s Law** : _the value of the overall\\nnetwork grows quadratically with the number of its participants._\\n\\nSay you build a social network app with N nodes (=users). There are N*(N-1)/2\\npossible connections (edges) between those nodes.\\n\\nThe value of a network -- say, the telephone network, Twitter/X, or even\\nBitcoin -- is often proportional to the number of possible connections.\\n\\nFor example, consider this example social network\\n\\n  * **N=1,000** users => **~1 million** connections\\n  * **N=10,000** users => **~100 million** connections\\n  * **N=1,000,000** users => **~1,000 billion** (!) connections\\n\\nThe larger your network becomes, the higher the value _per network\\nparticipant_. (Read this again.)\\n\\nWe\\'ve seen this phenomenon play out in many real social networks.\\n\\nFor example, Meta\\'s annual revenue per user was $5 in 2011 with 0.8 billion\\nusers, $20 in 2017 with 2 billion users, and $40 in 2022 with 2.9 billion\\nusers. As the user growth stalled, so did the revenue growth per user.\\n\\nSavvy investors model the value of a network using Metcalfe\\'s Law - that\\'s the\\nonly way you could\\'ve justified an early investment in Facebook in 2011.\\n\\nIt is tough to disrupt the largest network because it tends to make the most\\nmoney per user and can spend the most to acquire each user.\\n\\nDon\\'t try to compete against the dominating network in your field.\\n\\nEven if you\\'re Google and you\\'re trying to build your own social network, you\\nstill cannot compete.\\n\\nNow, the same holds for monetary networks like Bitcoin.\\n\\nI did the exercise and looked at the dominating decentralized monetary network\\nBitcoin through the lens of Metcalfe\\'s Law and network effects:\\n\\n\ud83d\udd17 [[Blog] Want Exploding Prices North of $500,000 per BTC? \"Grow N\" Says\\nMetcalfe\u2019s Law]({Link})\\n\\nTo my knowledge, this is the first attempt to model the Bitcoin price using\\nMetcalfe\\'s Law by setting N to the number of Bitcoin nodes rather than the\\nnumber of wallet addresses. The latter is not an optimal proxy for network\\nsize, given that exchanges may custody BTC for tens of millions of users in a\\nsingle wallet.\\n\\nThe purpose of this article is not to provide a definitive answer on how the\\nnumber of nodes can be utilized as a trading tool (although it appears to hold\\npotential). Rather, the aim is to stimulate your thinking. If you find this\\napproach useful, feel free to conduct your own modeling, research, or\\nbacktesting.\\n\\nFeel free to share any insight you may have - I\\'ll publish follow-up research\\non the Finxter blog and share it here in the community if your insights are\\nvaluable.\\n\\nLet\\'s be on the right side of change! \ud83d\ude80  \\nChris\\n\\n**[How are we doing?]({Link})**  \\n[\u2b50]({Link})  \\n[\u2b50\u2b50]({Link})  \\n[\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50]({Link})  \\n  \\nTo make sure you keep getting these emails, please add _chris@finxter.com_ to\\nyour address book.  \\n  \\nI\\'d love to hear your feedback so that I can improve this free email course\\nover time.

We crave negativity and, therefore, gladly pay negative media with our clicks and attention.\\n  * Third, you will be labeled naive when you\\'re crazy enough to share positive expectations. Some research suggests that negative people are perceived as more intelligent, competent, and expert than positive people.\\n\\nAs a result, third-party input data flowing into your brain is biased towards\\nnegativity.\\n\\nFrom LLM training, we know what happens with input data biases - they become\\noutput biases ingrained in the neural nets.\\n\\nBut any bias is dangerous: _\"What gets us into trouble is not what we don\\'t\\nknow. It\\'s what we know for sure that just ain\\'t so.\"_ \\\\- **Mark Twain** \u2712\ufe0f\\n\\nNow, let\\'s go to the more practical applications of this - _**how can we\\nexploit negativity bias?**_\\n\\nI think a simple exploit of negativity bias is arbitraging perception and\\nreality of technological disruptions and exponential long-term trends.\\n\\nWe are famously bad in understanding exponential growth and compound interest.\\nExponential trends can easily lead to extreme positive outcomes that are 100x\\nof what we initially expected.\\n\\n  1. **Ken Olsen (1977)** : _\"There is no reason for any individual to have a computer in their home.\"_\\n\\n  2. **Sir Alan Sugar (2005)** : _\"Next Christmas the iPod will be dead, finished, gone, kaput.\"_\\n\\n  3. **Steve Ballmer (2007)** : _\"There\\'s no chance that the iPhone is going to get any significant market share.\"_\\n\\nThis gross underestimation of exponential disruptions is a huge opportunity\\nfor tech enthusiasts like us.\\n\\n**We know that costs of AI training reduces by 70% per year, for example.**\\n\\nSo, spending $100 on AI training will get us 10x more in two years.\\n\\n100x in four years.\\n\\n1000x in 2030.\\n\\nThe [AI Scaling Laws]({Link}) teach us that neural nets keep improving in\\nperformance as we throw more compute, data, and parameters on the problem.\\n\\nIn other words, the intelligence explosion is unstoppable. Essentially, we\\nhave solved the problem of cheaply scaling human intelligence.\\n\\n**You can count on it.**\\n\\nSo you better position yourself to benefit from change now before reality has\\ncaught up and change is here.\\n\\nFor example, we don\\'t need to train a single human brain for 30 years,\\nspending $230,000 to put it through medical school. We still can, of course.\\n\\nBut with LLMs, we can now also replicate this brain 8 billion times and put it\\non 8 billion smartphones giving every human access to first-class medical\\ncare, 24/7, basically for free.\\n\\nWhen I talk about billions of humanoid bots, self-driving cars, autonomous AI\\nagents, intelligent factories, replacing inefficient management layers from\\ncompanies, automating policy and monetary systems, I need to do it with you as\\na fellow tech enthusiast and reader of this Finxter newsletter.\\n\\n**Because most people outside our little tech bubble don\\'t understand the\\nextent of upcoming disruptions.**\\n\\nAll of it will happen much faster than 99% of people expect due to the\\nexponential nature of declining cost curves.\\n\\nHumanity has woken up dead matter and injected life energy and intelligence\\ninto it. We are in the midst of a giant and literal explosion (see PS below).\\n\\nThe future is bright in every meaning of the word.\\n\\nLet\\'s be on the bright side of change! \ud83d\ude80  \\nChris\\n\\nPS: Check out this conversation of Lex Fridman prompting Tesla\\'s former head\\nof AI, Andrej Karpathy:\\n\\n_**Andrej** : And so basically, it does seem like synthetic intelligences are\\nkind of like the next stage of development. And I don\\'t know where it leads\\nto. Like At some point, I suspect the universe is some kind of a puzzle. And\\nthese synthetic AIs will uncover that puzzle and solve it._\\n\\n_**Lex** : And then what happens after, right? Because if you just fast\\nforward Earth many billions of years, it\\'s like it\\'s quiet and then it\\'s like\\ntormal, you see like city lights and stuff like that. And then what happens at\\nthe end? Like is it like a poof? Or is it like a calming, is it explosion?_\\n\\n_Is it like Earth like a giant, because you said emit roasters, will it start\\nemitting like a giant number of satellites?_\\n\\n_**Andrej** : Yes, it\\'s some kind of a crazy explosion. And we\\'re stepping\\nthrough a explosion and we\\'re like living day to day and it doesn\\'t look like\\nit. I saw a very cool animation of Earth and life on Earth and basically\\nnothing happens for a long time and then the last like 2 seconds, like\\nbasically cities and everything and the lower orbit just gets cluttered and\\njust the whole thing happens in the last 2 seconds and you\\'re like, this is\\nexploding, this is a state of explosion._\\n\\n_**Lex** : So if you play, yeah, yeah, if you play it at normal speed, it\\'ll\\njust look like an explosion._\\n\\n_**Andrej** : It\\'s a firecracker, we\\'re living in a firecracker._\\n\\n_**Lex** : Where it\\'s going to start emitting all kinds of interesting things.\\nAnd then, so explosion doesn\\'t, it might actually look like a little explosion\\nwith lights and fire and energy emitted, all that kind of stuff, but when you\\nlook inside the details of the explosion, there\\'s actual complexity happening\\nwhere there\\'s like, yeah, human life or some kind of life._\\n\\n_**Andrej** : We hope it\\'s not a destructive firecracker.

And the\\nnumber of freelancers keeps growing relative to the 3.3 billion employed\\npeople.\\n\\nSo, long story short, if you want to stay on the right side of change, the\\ndata-driven decision would be to consider adding freelancing to your income\\nstream. Even if freelancing represents only an additional means to make money\\nthat you can then reinvest to become an owner of scarce and desirable assets.\\n\\nFreelancing is here to stay. What\\'s the best way to start freelancing? Here\\'s\\na quick guide on the Finxter blog that\\'s still relevant:\\n\\n[[Blog] The Complete Guide to Freelance Developing]({Link})\\n\\nAlso, freelancing combines beautifully with exponential growth industries like\\nAI and Bitcoin.

Currently, it\\'s at $280 so this would represent a 55x.\\n\\nCrazy numbers, right?\\n\\nYes, this valuation represents just one potential path based on the success of\\nTesla\\'s humanoid bot program and the broader acceptance of humanoid bots in\\nsociety.\\n\\nAnd you\\'d have to perform a probability-weighted expected value calculation.\\nHowever, I believe the fact that this scenario is not too unlikely should make\\nus stop and think.\\n\\nTo position ourselves on the right side of change, sometimes we need to\\n**become owners rather than stay busy workers** forever.

I bet this one will be massive based on today\\'s \"woke\" society.\\n  * **AI Trainer** : Like a coach for AI, corrects its mistakes and teaches it to understand human speech or recognize images; $75,000 \u2013 $150,000. Autolabeling may be a threat though.\\n  * **Mental Health Professional** : Helps people through tough times, like a therapist listening to someone dealing with grief; $45,000 \u2013 $130,000. Mental health will be disrupted by AI eventually but most of it will be additional demand by \"normal people\" needing professional coaching and seeking personal development, IMO.\\n  * **Environmental Engineer** : Designs ways to install solar energy (booming!), clean oceans, or reduce pollution, such as creating sustainable waste management systems; $60,000 \u2013 $120,000.\\n  * **Special Education Teacher** : Tailors lessons for children with disabilities, such as using visual aids for a child with hearing impairment; $40,000 \u2013 $80,000.\\n  * **Healthcare Provider** : Takes care of patients, like a nurse assisting in surgery or a doctor using AI for early cancer detection; $80,000 \u2013 $300,000+.\\n  * **Social Worker** : Acts like a guiding friend, helping a struggling family find housing or a job; $40,000 \u2013 $80,000.\\n  * **Research Scientist** : Explores new frontiers, like discovering a new material that makes solar panels more efficient; $70,000 \u2013 $160,000.\\n  * **Creative Artist** : Paints, sculpts, or writes to express emotions or ideas, like an artist painting a mural that brings a community together; $20,000 \u2013 $100,000+.\\n  * **Human Resources Manager** : Like a matchmaker for companies and employees, finds the right people for the right jobs and helps them settle in; $65,000 \u2013 $200,000.\\n\\nPersonally, I\\'d add coding work that builds on and leverages LLM APIs and LLM-\\nbased meta tools such as auto GPTs and simply prompt engineering, as well as\\nBitcoin development on L2 (e.g., Lightning). Both are six-figure opportunities\\nfor sure.\\n\\nYou can read the full blog guide with beautiful visuals here:\\n\\n\ud83d\udc49 [[Blog] Ten Sustainable Career Paths in the Post-AI Economy]({Link})\\n\\n_Greetings from Hamburg, Germany. \ud83d\udea2_\\n\\nLet\\'s stay on the right side of change! \ud83d\ude80  \\nChris\\n\\n**[How are we doing?]({Link})**  \\n[\u2b50]({Link})  \\n[\u2b50\u2b50]({Link})  \\n[\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50]({Link})  \\n  \\nTo make sure you keep getting these emails, please add _chris@finxter.com_ to\\nyour address book.  \\n  \\nI\\'d love to hear your feedback so that I can improve this free email course\\nover time.

Your human time might be limited but\\nhuman time in general is a renewable resource.\\n\\n**Is energy the scarcest resource?**\\n\\nWell, no. Energy is infinite, and it is all around us. The sun is a giant\\nfusion reactor in the sky, and only a tiny portion of its emitted energy\\narrives on Earth.\\n\\nThink of the sun\\'s energy as Niagara Falls, but trillions of times larger,\\npouring out light instead of water. The tiny fraction that reaches Earth is\\nover 10,000 times our total energy use.\\n\\nIf harnessed effectively, it could power our world many times over.\\n\\n**Is USD the scarcest resource?**\\n\\nYou are on the right track, but no. They wouldn\\'t print it in the trillions if\\nfiat money were scarce. Look at any chart of the money supply growth (M1, M2,\\nM3) - they are all up to the right exponentially. \ud83d\udcc8\\n\\nNot how the supply of a scarce resource looks like.\\n\\n**What about gold or diamonds?**\\n\\nGold is one of the scarcest resources on Earth. Yet it has an annual supply\\ngrowth of 2% per year. We mine more and more gold without an upper limit.\\n\\nIf the price of gold were to go ballistic (e.g., 10x), gold miners would\\nprofitably mine much more gold. With increasing gold supply, the prices would\\nstart to go down again.\\n\\nThe world economy is a self-regulating organism.\\n\\nAs for diamonds, despite their reputation for rarity, they are actually more\\ncommon than gold when you look deep within Earth. You can even synthetically\\nproduce diamonds, so if the price rises, you\\'d mass-produce them, and the\\nprice would drop again.\\n\\nNeither gold nor diamonds are the scarcest resources on Earth.\\n\\n**What about scarce and desirable real estate?**\\n\\nThink of rare, prime real estate as the \\'Picassos\\' of the property world. Like\\noriginal works of art from a master painter, there\\'s a finite amount of this\\nprime property, especially in desirable areas like beachfronts or city\\ncenters.\\n\\nTo illustrate, imagine the Manhattan skyline as a limited-edition collection\\nof sculptures. Once they\\'re all taken, there\\'s no more space for new ones -\\nthe only way to get one is if someone decides to sell theirs. This is why\\nManhattan real estate is among the most expensive globally; there\\'s high\\ndemand, but the supply is fundamentally limited.\\n\\nIn this sense, rare real estate can be as scarce as a precious gem.\\n\\nYet - there\\'s always more land. Earth is big. There are 695,000 miles of\\ncoastline, 29 times the Earth\\'s circumference.\\n\\nWe could build more real estate in the desert, under the sea or floating on\\nit, on Mars, or just into the sky.\\n\\nIf you think about it, we\\'ll even build more real estate in digital worlds as\\nmore and more of our lives move into cyberspace. That\\'s one of the reasons\\nApple and Meta, two of the most profitable companies, focus on building\\nvirtual reality devices.\\n\\n**Is it intelligence?**\\n\\nNot with the recent intelligence explosion we\\'ve been witnessing. During the\\nlast few months, I\\'ve written extensively about LLM technology, AI, and\\nChatGPT.\\n\\nOur collective intelligence will go 1,000x over the next couple of decades.\\n\\n**So what is the most scarce resource on Earth?**\\n\\nThe answer is ... Bitcoin!\\n\\nPlain and simple.\\n\\nBitcoin is a monetary good with a fixed supply schedule. There will always\\nonly be 21,000,000 BTC units. Each is infinitely divisible but there cannot be\\nmore BTC without changing the protocol.\\n\\nUnlike gold, diamonds, real estate, human time, intelligence, and any other\\ngood on Earth, you cannot produce more of it when the price increases.\\n\\nWhen more miners try to generate more BTC, the difficulty adjustment will make\\nit harder to produce it. This protects the cap of 21 million monetary units\\nfrom being hacked by higher energy expenditure and increasing human ingenuity.\\n\\nIt is desirable. You can use it as the official payment instrument in a\\nhandful of countries already (like El Salvador).\\n\\nThere are an estimated 56 million millionaires in the world as of 2023. This\\nnumber is expected to grow to 87.5 million by 2026. Fiat inflation will\\ncontinue to produce more and more millionaires forever.\\n\\nSo not every USD millionaire can have a single Bitcoin, even though every USD\\nmillionaire will want one to diversify and protect their net worth.\\n\\nThe only reason this scarce monetary protocol works is decentralization\\n(otherwise, it would become a fiat currency controlled by a single party).\\nThat\\'s also why the 20k+ other cryptos are inferior: they are less\\ndecentralized.\\n\\nSoon an infinite number of intelligent agents based on LLMs and other AI\\ntechnologies will start to acquire the scarcest good on Earth, which makes it\\neven more scarce for ordinary people like you and me.\\n\\nUS presidential candidates now propose to buy BTC to stabilize the US balance\\nsheets.\\n\\nThe biggest asset managers in the world -- Blackrock, Fidelity, BNY Mellon,\\nVanguard -- have already started to accumulate BTC and will keep doing so.\\n\\nThe US will soon see a Bitcoin ETF, and a tsunami of new retail capital will\\ncompete for the scarcest resource on Earth.\\n\\nNothing is inevitable, but objectively, Bitcoin is and is likely to remain the\\nscarcest resource on Earth.\\n\\nTo your success! \ud83d\ude80  \\nChris\\n\\n**[How are we doing?]({Link})**  \\n[\u2b50]({Link})  \\n[\u2b50\u2b50]({Link})  \\n[\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50]({Link})  \\n  \\nTo make sure you keep getting these emails, please add _chris@finxter.com_ to\\nyour address book.  \\n  \\nI\\'d love to hear your feedback so that I can improve this free email course\\nover time.

From what we know, the\\ntraining data seems to include massive amounts of pirated books and\\ncopyrighted content such as the Harry Potter series - only that the LLM\\nobfuscates the copyright issues.\\n\\nIt\u2019s a gargantuan effort that converges in a matrix of numbers \u2014 the model\u2019s\\nparameters \u2014 that represent the learned patterns of human language.\\n\\nBy using an unprecedented amount of computing on an unprecedented amount of\\ndata on a simple neural network architecture (transformers), intelligence\\nseems to be an emergent phenomenon.\\n\\nI\u2019d go as far as to say that the age-old process of reproducing human\\nintelligence has been transcended. Intelligence is solved. LLMs will only\\nbecome smarter from now on. Like the Internet, LLMs will stay and proliferate\\nand penetrate every single sector of our economy.\\n\\nLLMs are densely compressed human wisdom, knowledge, and intelligence. Now\\nimagine having these files and being able to copy them millions of times,\\nrunning them all at once.\\n\\nSo picture this: Millions of intelligent student workers that are eager to\\nwork day and night on anything you want. How would you use them?\\n\\nIn this email, I want to challenge you to think of novel use cases for\\nmillions of intelligent workers working virtually for free.

HELL no!_\\n\\n_I would not do business with you or anyone who would do that to people.\\n[...]_\\n\\n_You do realize developers will be replaced the same way if we proceed down\\nthis route?_\\n\\n_What are all these displaced people going to do. Such tools need to be shut\\ndown until this issue is figured out,_\\n\\n_I am unsubscribing from your mailing list. I can\u2019t support such unethical\\nbehavior._\\n\\n~~~\\n\\nI understand that many feel threatened by the rapid technological acceleration\\nand the changes that come with it.\\n\\nThat\\'s why I write this daily newsletter to help you stay on the right side of\\nchange.\\n\\nAnd, of course, anybody not feeling in alignment with our overall optimistic\\nattitude toward technological developments should, in fact, unsubscribe from\\nthis email list immediately. No hard feelings.\\n\\nNow let me make my case:\\n\\nOur time on earth is limited. Many of us don\\'t enjoy meaningless work that\\ncould be automated. It\\'s frustrating!\\n\\nAnd why bother? We all know that meaningful work exists that doesn\\'t get done.\\n\\nSo, my general attitude towards automation is as follows:\\n\\n**_Every valuable task that can be automated, should be automated._**\\n\\nPolitics aside, here are two observations:\\n\\n(1) Many **_people don\\'t want to_** do the work, and  \\n(2) More and more **_machines can do_** the work cheaply, efficiently, and\\nwithout complaining.\\n\\nFor example, ChatGPT does an excellent job finding examples of how tech\\nadvancements impacted certain job roles:\\n\\n  * _**Scribes and Illuminators (Post-Printing Press):** Before the printing press, books were written by hand, often by monks in monasteries. The printing press made mass production of books possible, drastically reducing the need for manual scribes and illuminators who decorated manuscripts._\\n\\n  * _**Weavers and Textile Artisans (Industrial Revolution):** The invention of mechanized looms and other textile machinery during the Industrial Revolution significantly reduced the demand for handweaving, impacting artisans who had traditionally woven textiles by hand._\\n\\n  * _**Blacksmiths (Advent of Automobiles):** The widespread adoption of cars led to a decline in horse-drawn carriages, which adversely affected blacksmiths who were essential in making and repairing horse-drawn carriage components and horseshoes._\\n\\n  * _**Lamplighters (Electric Lighting):** Before electric streetlights, lamplighters were employed to light gas or oil street lamps every evening. The advent of electric lighting rendered this occupation obsolete._\\n\\n  * _**Telegraph Operators (Telephone and Internet):** With the advent of the telephone and later the internet, the need for telegraph operators, who transmitted messages using Morse code, diminished significantly._\\n\\n  * _**Typesetters (Digital Printing and Publishing):** The rise of digital printing technologies and desktop publishing software reduced the need for manual typesetters, who arranged letters for printing presses._\\n\\n  * _**Film Photographers and Darkroom Technicians (Digital Photography):** The digital photography revolution led to a decline in demand for traditional film-based photographers and darkroom technicians who developed film._\\n\\n  * _**Travel Agents (Online Booking Platforms):** The rise of online travel booking platforms has significantly reduced the need for traditional travel agents, as people can now plan and book trips themselves online._\\n\\n  * _**Bank Tellers (Online Banking and ATMs):** The introduction of ATMs and online banking services has decreased the need for as many bank tellers, as customers can perform many banking tasks themselves without visiting a branch._\\n\\n  * _**Video Store Clerks (Streaming Services):** The rise of online streaming services like Netflix and Hulu has dramatically reduced the demand for video rental stores, impacting the jobs of video store clerks._\\n\\nI didn\\'t hire a secretary to make this but paid $20/m to an AI company. Making\\nthis list would\\'ve taken me an hour or two - now it\\'s just a few seconds.\\n\\nIf you\\'re on the right side of change, you\\'ll get attacked for using electric\\nvehicles that drive themselves (no Uber driver!), streaming videos (no video\\nstores!), or purchasing online (no department stores!).\\n\\n**_\"I can\\'t support such unethical behavior.\"_**\\n\\nIn the end, of course, it doesn\\'t matter.\\n\\n_\"No force on earth can stop an idea whose time has come.\"_ \\\\- **Victor Hugo**\\n\\nSo why bother? There is no moral high ground for not using technology.\\n\\nIn fact, if we don\\'t adopt new technologies, we\\'ll die!\\n\\nAdapt or die.\\n\\nBe on the right side of change! \ud83d\ude80  \\nChris\\n\\n**[How are we doing?]({Link})**  \\n[\u2b50]({Link})  \\n[\u2b50\u2b50]({Link})  \\n[\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50]({Link})  \\n  \\nTo make sure you keep getting these emails, please add _chris@finxter.com_ to\\nyour address book.  \\n  \\nI\\'d love to hear your feedback so that I can improve this free email course\\nover time.

It adds little value to the world.\\n\\nBecause everybody is doing it, most won\\'t make money this way.\\n\\nSo let\\'s move on:\\n\\n**Route #2 - Create Quality Content**\\n\\nA much better route.\\n\\nYou can use AI to do research and help you obtain, analyze, and visualize\\ndata.\\n\\nCode interpreter and [GPTs]({Link}) can help you enrich your content. Use\\nChatGPT to fix grammar mistakes and improve clarity.\\n\\nThe Internet is a winner-takes-most market. In other words, increasing your\\ncontent quality just a tiny bit can double your reach.\\n\\nWant to double your reach again? Increase the quality of your content even\\nmore!\\n\\nMister Beast teaches us that it never ends.\\n\\nDue to the winner-takes-most dynamics, investing human time in content quality\\npays off in the long term.\\n\\nThe opposite is also true: you should definitely use AI to enrich your content\\nwith unique insights or tools.\\n\\nFor instance, a human chess player guiding a chess AI will beat both, an\\nexpert chess player without AI, and a chess AI without guiding humans.\\n\\nFor that reason, AI-enriched human content is a sustainable route to leverage\\nAI to make money and have a real positive impact.\\n\\n**Route #3 - Sell Your Consulting Services**\\n\\nStill - both routes #1 and #2 are very crowded and it takes years of daily\\neffort just to get the foot in the door.\\n\\nYou need to love the game, or you won\\'t make it through the years of unpaid\\nwork. The content creation market is brutal and if you see small success,\\nyou\\'ll get copied very quickly.\\n\\nMoreover, content creation doesn\\'t pay off quickly - successful content\\ncreators give it their all for many years before reaching good income levels.\\n\\nIt\\'s not easy. You must become an expert.\\n\\nAn easier route in my opinion -- higher _expected value_ and a priori _success\\nprobability_ \\\\-- is to help businesses integrate [alien technology]({Link})\\ninto their existing business systems.\\n\\nThe LLM paradigm shift has not yet trickled into the \"normal\" world. Millions\\nof businesses still need to integrate generative AI in their workflows.\\n\\nWe are in year #1 of publicly available LLM [APIs]({Link}).\\n\\nEven without considering likely improvements of the foundational models, it\\'ll\\ntake years to connect and integrate LLMs with real world business systems.\\n\\n**Who Pays for AI Consultants?**\\n\\nArchitects, financial advisors, grocery stores, software companies,\\nrestaurants, clothing stores, laundromats, bookstores, fitness centers,\\ndaycare centers -- all of them can and eventually will improve efficiency,\\ni.e., maximize benefit/cost ratio, by integrating LLMs into their workflows.\\n\\nAs an exercise to train your business savvy, feel free to take a minute to\\ncome up with little ways to use generative AI and LLMs to improve each of\\nthese businesses!\\n\\nThink small.\\n\\nSome minor examples:\\n\\n  * If you run a hair salon, can you delight your customers by using the [Midjourney]({Link}) **_/merge_** command to experiment with personalized hair pictures of your customers?\\n  * If you run a small factory, can you use [OpenAI\\'s text-to-speech (TTS) library]({Link}) to welcome customers at the front door?\\n  * If you are a financial advisor, can you delight your clients by using LLMs to [enrich portfolio analysis]({Link}) or visualize your clients\\' portfolios?\\n  * As a solar company, can you fully automate offer creation by means of a [fine-tuned]({Link}) LLM?\\n\\n[AI consultants on Upwork]({Link}) make $100 per hour and more. Why? Because\\nof the huge leverage they offer to normal businesses that just don\\'t know how\\nto do these things.\\n\\nIf you are such a business owner, hiring an AI consultancy for three hours\\ncould increase your customer satisfaction and revenue by 10%, 20%, or even\\n100%!\\n\\n_Who wouldn \\'t spend a few hundred bucks on that bet?_\\n\\nMoreover, to reduce perceived risk and boost revenue, creative AI consultants\\ncan propose revenue-share models where local businesses don\\'t need to pay\\nupfront - but only an agreed-upon percentage of increased revenue after\\nsuccess.\\n\\nIn that case, the average hourly rate could be much higher, as the AI\\nconsultants would get a stake in the businesses.\\n\\nConsider what I wrote a couple of emails ago:\\n\\n_\" I\\'d rather hire one skilled prompt engineer than ten graphic designers\"_\\n\\nThe same would apply to 50/50 partnerships.\\n\\nThis opportunity is massive for anybody who wants to be on the right side of\\nchange. Collectively, there\\'s orders of magnitude more revenue in serving\\nbusinesses than in content creation.\\n\\nScalability and passivity can be obtained through creative partnerships.\\n\\nFor example, boosting revenue by 20% of a business making $50k/m can increase\\nbusiness value by $100k to $500k. Many small businesses in your local\\nenvironment have these revenue levels.\\n\\nAnd who knows, there may be a possibility to scale up the consultancy to a\\nmore [scalable Saas business]({Link}) to take it to the next level?\\n\\nBe on the right side of change! \ud83d\ude80  \\nChris\\n\\n\\n\\n**[How are we doing?]({Link})**  \\n[\u2b50]({Link})  \\n[\u2b50\u2b50]({Link})  \\n[\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50]({Link})  \\n  \\nTo make sure you keep getting these emails, please add _chris@finxter.com_ to\\nyour address book.  \\n  \\nI\\'d love to hear your feedback so that I can improve this free email course\\nover time.

It becomes increasingly apparent that this\\nnew economy will be built on Bitcoin Lightning rails, i.e., _\"permissionless\\nmoney over IP\"_.\\n\\n  * AI agents don\\'t have access to VISA cards, nor will they pay 2% transaction fees to VISA because sending money 35x back and forth would result in a 50% monetary loss to VISA!\\n  * AI agents cannot create bank accounts. But they will participate in the global economy eventually. So the question is: how?\\n  * AI agents cannot afford to lose half their purchasing power in just 35x transactions.\\n\\nThey _need_ permissionless money over IP.\\n\\nThe technically superior solution with the highest uptime and the solution\\nwith the strongest network effects right now is _Bitcoin Lightning_ for micro\\ntransactions due to its decentralized, open-source, permissionless access, as\\nwell as its 24/7*365 availability, and immediate final settlement properties.\\n\\nAs a coder, if you want to learn how to create LLMs with access to money over\\nIP, feel free to check out today\\'s Finxter article:\\n\\n[[Blog] Injecting Life Energy Into AIs with Bitcoin, LLMs, APIs, & Lightning\\n\u26a1\ud83e\udd16]({Link})\\n\\nAlso, if you\\'d love to recap the philosophical foundations of the emerging\\ncrypto industry, check out [this]({Link}) interesting talk given a couple of\\ndays ago by Bitcoin OG Erik Voorhees on YouTube.\\n\\nLet\\'s be on the right side of change! \ud83d\ude80  \\nChris\\n\\n**[How are we doing?]({Link})**  \\n[\u2b50]({Link})  \\n[\u2b50\u2b50]({Link})  \\n[\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50]({Link})  \\n  \\nTo make sure you keep getting these emails, please add _chris@finxter.com_ to\\nyour address book.  \\n  \\nI\\'d love to hear your feedback so that I can improve this free email course\\nover time.

The principle of \"Garbage in, Garbage out\"\\napplies here.\\n\\nIf you regularly consume superficial news with a negativity bias, it\\'s easy to\\npredict how your brain might respond to new information: with rejection,\\ndoubt, and criticism, often stemming from impulsive thinking.\\n\\nI receive statements like these: _\"... I read that AI already becomes dumber,\\nand it only averages all available information without producing anything new\\nor creative ...\"_\\n\\nIf you point people to research indicating that ChatGPT ranks higher on\\ncreativity tests, they argue that the tests must be faulty. Yeah, sure they\\nare faulty. Still, it\\'s better to go with Occam\\'s Razor, embrace the simple\\nexplanation, and remain open-minded in the face of change.\\n\\nIt may sound amusing, but many people dismiss the idea that [Large Language\\nModels (LLMs)]({Link}) are a disruptive force, set to multiply their impact\\ntenfold every two years, thanks to the exponential decline of AI training\\ncosts.\\n\\nThe contrary to \"Garbage-In Garbage-Out\" also holds: if you train a model (or\\nyour brain for that matter) on high-quality data, you\\'re much more likely to\\nproduce high-quality outputs.\\n\\n_Quality-In Quality-Out_\\n\\nSo how can you cleanse your training data and, thereby, boost the performance\\nof the AI model that is your brain?\\n\\nHere are some strategies I employ:\\n\\n  * **Go for long walks.** After a walk in nature, I always find clarity about my next step. Taking one step at a time, with a distant long-term goal in mind, simplifies life. Clarity becomes increasingly vital as the influx of low-quality information leads to confusion, brain fog, and fatigue.\\n  * **Think slowly and take time.** Many people form shallow and hasty conclusions, presenting them with undue confidence. I\\'ve learned that such quick opinions, though easy to offer, often hold little value.\\n  * **Listen to podcasts with field experts** but only on topics within their expertise; I avoid those who speak outside their domain. Don\\'t necessarily listen on Bitcoiner\\'s advice on food or the money tips from broke people (you may be able to leverage the powerful technique of inversion though: _do the opposite_ ).\\n  * **Occasionally browse Twitter** /X \u2013 but not too often, as it can be a time sink. Among the noise, you might find a valuable insight, but I\\'m cautious with social media. Better yet - avoid all social media including X.\\n  * **Read select tech and coding newsletters**. I strive to offer such a newsletter with a high signal-to-noise ratio \u2013 you be the judge.\\n  * **Skim ArXiv** and new research papers: these are often a rich source of knowledge and remain some of the highest-quality information available.\\n  * **HackerNews** is also an excellent source for straightforward news with a high signal-to-noise ratio.\\n\\nThis brings us to today\\'s Finxter tutorial if you\\'re interested in building\\nyour own HackerNews-like site:\\n\\n[[Blog] How I Coded a Hacker News Clone in Django]({Link})\\n\\nEnjoy reading!

The top 10 out of 1000 GPTs are likely to\\ncreate value for millions of people.\\n\\nYour top GPT among 1000 may reach tens of millions of people.\\n\\nBut the remaining 990 are still valuable because they make the few winners\\npossible.

It\\'s outside. I\\'ll leave it with\\nyou. That\\'ll more than cover the $10,000.\"_\\n\\n**Banker** : _\"Yeah, that\\'s more than enough security.\"_\\n\\nAfter her vacation, the woman returns to the bank. She meets with the same\\nloan officer and repays the $10,000 plus the $49 in interest.\\n\\nAs she\\'s about to leave, the banker asks, _\"You\\'re a wealthy woman. Why borrow\\nmoney for a trip?\"_\\n\\nThe woman smiles, then replies, _\"Where else in San Francisco can I safely\\npark a $350,000 Rolls for two weeks for only $69?\"_\\n\\n~~~\\n\\nIt wouldn\\'t surprise me if the woman\\'s skill of thinking outside the box, in a\\nfirst-principle, interdisciplinary way, was how she became wealthy in the\\nfirst place.\\n\\nThe woman is an intelligent _user_ of the system that leverages the system in\\ncreative ways to maximize value.\\n\\nWith the rise of LLMs, this skill of _thinking outside the box_ has become\\ninvaluable.\\n\\n**Infrastructure vs Application: Who got richer, the founders of AT &T; or\\nGoogle? **\\n\\nSimilarly, the generative AI revolution will create far more value for\\nintelligent (=street smart) _users_ of the models that create higher-level\\nservices as compared to the _providers_ of the model infrastructure.\\n\\nFor example, my bet is on Tesla with its _AI apps_ like self-driving and\\nhumanoid bots, rather than NVidia as the _provider of AI infrastructure_ such\\nas chips and AI-training-as-a-service.\\n\\nInfrastructure tends to become commoditized over time.\\n\\nStartup.ai companies like Character.ai using LLM tools like Langchain will\\ncreate far more relative value compared to infrastructure companies such as\\nOpenAI.\\n\\nBoth AI application and AI infrastructure businesses may grow substantially.\\nBut the outsized gains will be made by the AI application businesses where\\nowners think in interdisciplinary ways to create apps that actually bridge the\\nnew technologies into the real world.\\n\\nDiscovering LLMs (Simon Willison calls it \"[Alien technology]({Link})\") is\\nlike the discovery of electricity.\\n\\nNow, more than 100 years after Nikola Tesla, Thomas Edison, and others\\npopularized the use of electricity, we\\'re still developing applications on top\\nof it - such as the Internet, Bitcoin, or even LLMs.\\n\\nAnd we\\'re already developing new applications on top of Bitcoin and LLMs.\\nProgress often happens layer after layer after layer. One of the new base\\nlayers of humanity is infinitely scalable intelligence.\\n\\nFor instance, we can now access powerful proprietary LLMs via API (e.g.,\\n[GPT-4-32k]({Link})) or offline, free, and open-source LLMs like [Llama\\n2]({Link}) or others:\\n\\n  * [MPT-7B: A Free Open-Source Large Language Model (LLM)]({Link})\\n  * [The Open-Source Ecosystem Outruns Tech Giants: A Shift in AI Landscape]({Link})\\n\\nThe question now becomes how to integrate those models into real-world\\napplications.\\n\\nLet me be blunt: **Don\\'t waste your time trying to figure out the math and\\ntheory of AI if you\\'re not already an AI researcher and enthusiast. Instead,\\nfocus on using LLMs in your particular area of expertise.**\\n\\nFor example, if you\\'re working in packaging \ud83d\ude09, try fine-tuning a\\n[GPT-3.5]({Link}) model to handle common packaging queries in your business,\\npossibly reducing customer service overhead by 10%.\\n\\nOr, if you\\'re working in game design, can you integrate the most popular\\npersonas from _character.ai_ into your RPCs to make your game world truly rich\\nin social experience?\\n\\nThese low-hanging fruits are everywhere now - ripe for the taking. And you\\ndon\\'t need to be an AI professor, either. Just be a curious and playful user\\nof the new tech.\\n\\nYou\\'re just one intelligent prompt away from changing the world. \ud83e\udd2f\\n\\n**TL;DR** : Moving forward, the application layer of generative AI will grow\\neven faster than AI infrastructure service providers.

I admitted that the\\ninformation was very thin.\\n\\nBut in a fresh exclusive with _The Verge_ , Sam Altman dropped the following\\nbombshell:\\n\\n  * _**Interviewer** : The reports about the Q* model breakthrough that you all recently made, what\u2019s going on there?_\\n  * _**Sam Altman** : No particular comment on that unfortunate leak. But what we have been saying \u2014 two weeks ago, what we are saying today, what we\u2019ve been saying a year ago, what we were saying earlier on \u2014 is that we expect progress in this technology to continue to be rapid and also that we expect to continue to work very hard to figure out how to make it safe and beneficial._\\n\\nIn my logic: _**If Sam calls it a leak, it must be real.**_ (?)\\n\\nDiving deeper into the topic, I found the following interesting nugget:\\n\\n_\"The [...] breakthrough allowed OpenAI to overcome limitations on obtaining\\nenough high-quality data to train new models [...] The research involved using\\ncomputer-generated [data], rather than real-world data like text or images\\npulled from the internet, to train new models. That appears to be a reference\\nto the idea of training algorithms with so-called synthetic training data,\\nwhich has emerged as a way to train more powerful AI models.\" _\\\\-- **Wired**\\n\\nLike Tesla\\'s new end-to-end full-self-driving (FSD) system, synthetic data is\\nnow being used by OpenAI to train neural nets!\\n\\nI share this with you because I believe the following take is not well-\\nunderstood by the general public:\\n\\n  * The [AI Scaling Laws]({Link}) suggest we have **not reached saturation** in performance - all we need to do is throw more compute and more data on the problem.\\n  * Many argue that data is the limiting factor - e.g., in humanoid robotics, we don\\'t have a lot of real-world data.\\n  * However, **if we can effectively train models on synthetic data, we\\'ve mitigated this bottleneck!**\\n\\nWe\\'re already seeing a double-digit percentage productivity improvement for\\nour economy due to LLMs. This trend is sustainable for at least a couple of\\nyears. Maybe decades!\\n\\nHave a look at this research result in a recent first-class paper _\"GPTs are\\nGPTs: An Early Look at the Labor Market Impact Potential of Large Language\\nModels\"_ :\\n\\n\ud83e\uddd1\\u200d\ud83d\udcbb _\"Our findings reveal that around 80% of the U.S. workforce could have at\\nleast 10% of their work tasks affected by the introduction of LLMs, while\\napproximately 19% of workers may see at least 50% of their tasks impacted.\\n[...]\" _\\n\\nAnother big takeaway is this: **when synthetic data is an effective option,\\nthe bottleneck for AI will be _compute_.** Singularity will take our hunger\\nfor compute to the moon.\\n\\n10x, 100x, 1000x of demand for AI compute in a few years wouldn\\'t surprise me\\nin the least.\\n\\nBullish for AI compute providers like NVDA, AMZN, and TSLA!\\n\\nBe on the right side of change! \ud83d\ude80  \\nChris\\n\\nPS: The winner of the Finxter GPT Creator contest is Julian\\'s **_Eco Chef\\nGPT_**.\\n\\nIn Julian\\'s words:\\n\\n_\"Eco Chef is a GPT to analyze the environmental impact of food recipes, with\\na focus on providing CO2 equivalent (CO2E) values for every ingredient in the\\nrecipe.

Can. Only. Perform. From. Your. **STRENGTHS.**\\n\\nRoughly one hundred million (!) people have taken the Myers and Briggs\\npersonality test. The 16personalities website ( _not affiliated_ ) is one of\\nthe most viral websites out there.\\n\\n**tl;dr:** You answer a couple of questions and the test assigns one of 16\\ndifferent personalities to you based on the following four dimensions:\\n\\n  1. **Extraversion (E) vs. Introversion (I):** Where do you direct your energy? Outwardly towards people and activities or inwardly towards thoughts and ideas.\\n  2. **Sensing (S) vs. Intuition (N):** How do you prefer to take in information? Through direct and concrete facts or by interpreting and adding meaning.\\n  3. **Thinking (T) vs. Feeling (F):** How do you prefer to make decisions? Based on logic and consistency or based on the people and special circumstances.\\n  4. **Judging (J) vs. Perceiving (P):** What\\'s your preference when dealing with the outside world? With a planned and organized approach or a more flexible and spontaneous approach.\\n\\nI found the test to be very robust. For example, no matter how often I repeat\\nthe test - I\\'ve done it at least a dozen times over the years - it always\\ngives me INFJ (Advocate).\\n\\nThey may be right: I feel awful writing about this; the test lists as one of\\nmy weaknesses to being \"reluctant to open up\".\\n\\nAnyways, just for fun I\\'ve written a small online tool where you can put in\\nyour personality type and it provides you with a possible career path in tech\\n(tech enthusiasts only!).\\n\\n[[Online Tool] What\u2019s Your Career Path Based on Myers-Briggs\u2019 16\\nPersonalities?]({Link})\\n\\nThe \"recommendation\" is crude so don\\'t take it too seriously.

They convert concepts into number sequences, which\\nenables computers to comprehend the relationships between these concepts more\\neasily.\\n\\nOpenAI\u2019s embedding models, such as text-embedding-ada-002, have been designed\\nto outperform other top models in various standard benchmarks, including a 20%\\nrelative improvement in code search performance.\\n\\n**\ud83d\udca1 Principle**\\n\\nYou should know that isn\\'t proprietary to OpenAI, but rather a broadly\\nrecognized principle within the machine learning field.\\n\\nIn a nutshell, when someone talks about _\"computing the embedding of a text\"_\\n, they\\'re essentially converting that text into a unique numerical form.\\nHowever, this isn\\'t just any number - it\\'s a special kind of number that\\nallows arithmetic operations to be conducted with words or phrases, a task at\\nwhich computers excel.\\n\\n**\ud83e\uddd2 Child + \u23f2\ufe0f Time = ?**\\n\\nAs an example, using embeddings, you could mathematically express something\\nlike \"child\" + \"time\" equating to \"adult\" or \"queen\" minus \"female\" resulting\\nin \"king\".\\n\\nI saw this example in a Reddit threat - lovely isn\\'t it?\\n\\nAnother handy feature of these numbers is that you can use them to group alike\\nwords together. For instance, \"dog\" and \"puppy\" would have numbers that are\\nrelatively close to each other, but significantly distant from \"submarine\".\\n\\n**\ud83d\udd0d Embeddings - Used for Search**\\n\\nFor users of Language Learning Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT, embeddings are\\ntypically leveraged for search operations. Bear in mind that LLMs have finite\\nspace for the input and output, often referred to as the context window,\\nmeaning you can\\'t process an entire book, for example.\\n\\nIf you wanted to extract information about the book, you\\'d divide it into\\nsmaller sections that can fit within the context window, and then you\\'d follow\\nthese steps:\\n\\n1\\\\. Compute the embedding for each section.  \\n2\\\\. Once you\\'ve calculated the \"number\" (embedding) for each section, take the\\nuser prompt and compute its embedding.  \\n3\\\\. Next, compare the user embedding to the book section embeddings and\\nidentify the closest one. Since these are numerical values, you can use a\\nmathematical function to determine their proximity (cosine distance is\\nrecommended by OpenAI).  \\n4\\\\. Now, you can pass the question to GPT, accompanied by the relevant section\\nthat you\\'ve just identified.\\n\\nThis procedure is extremely useful and versatile, and can be implemented for\\nvarious data sources, including emails in your inbox, documents on your drive,\\nor even Amazon reviews.\\n\\nI hope this explanation clarifies the concept for you!\\n\\n**\ud83d\ude80 What\\'s Next?**\\n\\nStay tuned for our upcoming emails on LLMs and exciting new tech developments.\\n\ud83e\uddd1\\u200d\ud83d\udcbb\ud83d\udc69\\u200d\ud83d\udcbb\\n\\nAnd if you haven\\'t already, check out our newly-launched course on advanced\\nprompt engineering (e.g., using embeddings) on the Finxter Academy:\\n\\n[[Academy] Prompt Engineering with Python and OpenAI]({Link})\\n\\nTo your success! \ud83d\ude80  \\nChris\\n\\n**[How are we doing?]({Link})**  \\n[\u2b50]({Link})  \\n[\u2b50\u2b50]({Link})  \\n[\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50]({Link})  \\n  \\nTo make sure you keep getting these emails, please add _chris@finxter.com_ to\\nyour address book.  \\n  \\nI\\'d love to hear your feedback so that I can improve this free email course\\nover time.

ChatGPT will not only be faster and\\nproduce better quality results but also feel much more natural.\\n\\nI know many Googlers are reading this newsletter and hope that research papers\\nlike these can escalate the urgency of pushing their UX to the next level - I\\nwould prefer not to see Google falling for the innovator\\'s dilemma.\\n\\nIf you\\'re still interested in some fascinating new research papers, check out\\nthe following fresh paper showing how Microsoft Research has applied ChatGPT\\nto robotics:\\n\\n[[Research] ChatGPT Breaks New Ground in Robotics!

The\\nresearchers are top-notch. So allow me to recap the 4-step prompting strategy\\nhere quickly:\\n\\n  1. **Drafting an Initial Response:** The language model drafts an initial response based on the input query.\\n  2. **Planning Verification Questions:** The language model then devises verification questions to fact-check its draft.\\n  3. **Answering Verification Questions:** These questions are answered independently to avoid bias.\\n  4. **Generating a Final Verified Response:** Utilizing the answers, the model refines its initial draft and generates a final, more accurate response.\\n\\nAs prompt engineers, we should build a mental library of these prompting\\nstrategies. You never know if or when you\\'ll come up with that million-dollar\\nprompt that disrupts an industry!\\n\\nI believe the immediate future of high-performant LLMs will be **multi-model,\\nmulti-modal systems** where multiple AIs or AI agents work together in a\\ndynamic pipeline of self-promptings to generate highly enriched answers that\\noutperform the prompting results of individual models.\\n\\nThat is -- at least until the one AGI model that rules them all rises from the\\nmountains of new AI research published daily. \ud83e\udd16\\n\\nLet\\'s be on the right side of change! \ud83d\ude80  \\nChris\\n\\n\\n\\n**[How are we doing?]({Link})**  \\n[\u2b50]({Link})  \\n[\u2b50\u2b50]({Link})  \\n[\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50]({Link})  \\n  \\nTo make sure you keep getting these emails, please add _chris@finxter.com_ to\\nyour address book.  \\n  \\nI\\'d love to hear your feedback so that I can improve this free email course\\nover time.

(No worries if you don\\'t know them - I didn\\'t.)\\n\\nLike ChatGPT, it can pass many human-centric tests such as grade school math\\nproblem solving, Q&A; on very long stories, answering science questions, or\\nreading comprehension. And it beats most humans.\\n\\nAnd like ChatGPT, Claude 2 can even pass the bar (lawyer) and the USMLE test\\n(medicine).\\n\\nBut unlike ChatGPT and most other open-source models, it can process 200k\\ntoken context data!! \ud83e\udd2f\\n\\nYou can get a quick overview on the Finxter blog:\\n\\n\ud83d\udd17 [[Blog] Claude 2 LLM Reads Ten Papers in One Prompt with Massive 200k Token\\nContext]({Link})\\n\\nCurrently, US citizens can already try it out. You can upload your PDFs and do\\nall the fun stuff the rest of the world (*cough* Germany) cannot access yet\\n(*cough* without VPN).\\n\\nNow you may wonder - is a 200k token (~150k words) context window large?\\n\\nAn average novel is around 80,000 to 100,000 words.\\n\\nSo, 150,000 words would be equivalent to a long novel or perhaps a trilogy of\\nshorter novels. For example, \u201cHarry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix\u201d by\\nJ.K. Rowling is over 257,000 words.\\n\\nMy doctoral thesis was only 57k so you could load multiple Ph.D. theses into a\\nsingle prompt.\\n\\nThis is insane. And I don\\'t understand why so many people try to tamper my\\nexcitement - don\\'t they get exponentials?\\n\\nIn fact, most humans would struggle if I handed them two Ph.D. theses and\\nasked them to write a detailed comparison. But all of this could be done in a\\nsingle 200k context window!\\n\\nCheck out the blog, charts, and Claude 2 model and stay tuned for tomorrow\\'s\\nemail where I\\'ll show you another great tech achievement.\\n\\nTo your success! \ud83d\ude80  \\nChris\\n\\n**[How are we doing?]({Link})**  \\n[\u2b50]({Link})  \\n[\u2b50\u2b50]({Link})  \\n[\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50]({Link})  \\n  \\nTo make sure you keep getting these emails, please add _chris@finxter.com_ to\\nyour address book.  \\n  \\nI\\'d love to hear your feedback so that I can improve this free email course\\nover time.

Since the\\ndesign of machines is one of these intellectual activities, an ultra-\\nintelligent machine could design even better machines; there would then\\nunquestionably be an \\'intelligence explosion\\', and the intelligence of man\\nwould be left far behind.\"_\\n\\n**Stephen Hawking** worried that _\"The development of full artificial\\nintelligence could spell the end of the human race. It would take off on its\\nown, and re-design itself at an ever-increasing rate. Humans, who are limited\\nby slow biological evolution, couldn\\'t compete, and would be superseded.\"_\\n\\nOkay, I\\'m more optimistic. Positive change in the AI space is not slowing\\ndown. It accelerates. For instance, here are some news headlines that I\\ncollected during the last couple of days:\\n\\n  * _**Tesla\\'s Optimus** robot can now sort objects autonomously using an end-to-end neural network system similar to the groundbreaking full self-driving system presented earlier this month._\\n  * _Amazon is investing up to **$4 billion in[Anthropic]({Link})**._\\n  * _**ChatGPT is getting multi-modal** capabilities, allowing users to speak to the model, have it speak back, and upload images for questions._\\n  * _**Spotify introduces AI-powered voice translation** for podcasts using [OpenAI\\'s Whisper]({Link}), maintaining the original voice in translations._\\n  * _**ChatGPT** helps diagnose tethered cord syndrome in a boy, highlighting AI\\'s potential in [**medical applications**]({Link})._\\n  * _**OpenAI announces DALL-E 3** with enhanced features and integration with ChatGPT._\\n  * _**Google\\'s Bard chatbot now offers a \"double-check\"** feature to enhance accuracy and accountability._\\n\\nIn today\\'s email, I want to share three _\"coping mechanisms\"_ to help you\\nthrive in the upcoming decades.\\n\\n**\u2705 First, you can be certain about one thing: change.**\\n\\nStay open-minded, set aside daily time to learn, apply, and play with new\\ntechnologies such as those mentioned above.\\n\\nTo help you stay on the right side of change, we\\'ll be here with Finxter\\nduring the next decade or so with small daily doses of tech knowledge.\\n\\n**\u2705 Second, you strive to be an owner not merely a user of new technologies.**\\n\\nTechnological disruption will create an abundance of many things but it will\\ninherently flow to the owners of the technology first.\\n\\nInvesting in scarce desirable assets will remain a great idea.\\n\\nThe [scarcest and most desirable asset]({Link}) is Bitcoin. The infinity of AI\\nmeets the scarcity of Bitcoin. Supply is fixed and demand will explode so you\\nfigure out my price expectations for BTC: \ud83d\udcc8\\n\\n**\u2705 Third, focus on love and lasting relationships instead of work.**\\n\\nMuch of the work you\\'re doing today will be done by robots tomorrow. Why\\nbother sacrificing quality time with your family just so you can cram in a\\nlittle bit of additional work?\\n\\nJust use LLMs for automation, cut your work time by half, and let the machines\\ndo your job better than you could. A single intelligent prompt you create at\\nthe right time and the right location could accomplish more than a lifetime of\\nunskilled labor.\\n\\nAgain focus on being an owner and early user of new tech. Don\\'t focus on being\\na working bee. There\\'s little reward for being a hard worker in a fully\\nautomated factory. But there is a significant reward for being the owner and,\\npossibly, designer of this same factory.\\n\\nLet\\'s be on the right side of change! \ud83d\ude80  \\nChris\\n\\n**[How are we doing?]({Link})**  \\n[\u2b50]({Link})  \\n[\u2b50\u2b50]({Link})  \\n[\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50]({Link})  \\n  \\nTo make sure you keep getting these emails, please add _chris@finxter.com_ to\\nyour address book.  \\n  \\nI\\'d love to hear your feedback so that I can improve this free email course\\nover time.

Machines doing\\nmore and more of that heavy lifting keeps undermining my feeling of self-\\nworth:\\n\\n_Why am I here?_\\n\\nMillions of Finxters struggle with the same question, consciously or\\nsubconsciously.\\n\\nSo, allow me to make explicit what is often missed due to it being too\\nobvious:\\n\\n**\u2b50 Our job roles should _not_ be the source of our self-esteem or worthiness.\\n\u2b50**\\n\\nAssociating our self-worth with our work is a precarious position to be in, as\\nit makes us vulnerable to external changes. If our self-worth is too deeply\\nintertwined with our job, any threat to that job can feel like a personal\\nattack, leading us to either resist change or feel lost and devalued when\\nchange is inevitable.\\n\\nConsider retirement as an example.\\n\\nIt\\'s often observed that people, particularly men, face a crisis of identity\\nand purpose post-retirement. This can lead to serious health implications -\\neven earlier deaths soon after their well-deserved retirement.\\n\\n_\"If we are not needed, why live at all?\"_\\n\\nLegions of men focus all their effort, energy, and self-worth on career\\nsuccess rather than quality relationships. And more and more women are\\nstarting to repeat that same mistake.\\n\\nYou are not your job. As we detach our self-worth from our job roles, we\\nbecome more resilient to such transitions.\\n\\nBy perceiving our career not as a defining part of our identity but rather as\\na dynamic and enjoyable game, we open ourselves to new opportunities. This\\napproach increases our psychological safety, making us more adaptable and\\nefficient.\\n\\nWhen we view technologies such as LLMs as tools to play with rather than\\nthreats to our jobs, we can disrupt our own roles in positive ways, leading to\\ngreater success and fulfillment.\\n\\n_**So, where should we draw self-confidence and identity from if not from our\\njobs?**_\\n\\nThe answer, in my opinion, is profound:\\n\\nIf somebody loves you, you are still needed by them.\\n\\nIf you have loving relationships, your feeling of self-worth becomes\\nantifragile against disruptive change. More robots and AI agents lead to\\nhigher productivity, which reduces the need for human work.\\n\\nLet\\'s take the PoV of the older man or woman you will be. You\\'ll most\\ncertainly regret not spending more time with your loved ones. You won\\'t regret\\nspending less time at work - especially as machines disrupt your work.\\n\\nThe singularity is here, and it\\'ll gift us flexibility and freedom. We should\\nembrace it not as a threat but as an exciting opportunity for growth and focus\\non what truly matters in our lives - quality relationships, love, and health.\\n\\nFrom this perspective, disruptions help us obtain _more_ confidence and self-\\nworth.\\n\\nAs individuals, I believe it\\'s best if we reach the mindset that technological\\ndisruption is just a multiplayer game providing us with magical items and\\nalien tech LLMs to level up our gameplay.\\n\\nThis not only safeguards our mental and emotional well-being but also\\npositions us on the right side of change, ready to thrive in an ever-evolving\\nworld.\\n\\nBe on the right side of change. \ud83d\ude80  \\nChris\\n\\n**\ud83d\udc69\\u200d\ud83d\udcbb Action step** : Chill out at your job today - don\\'t take it too\\nseriously.\\n\\n**[How are we doing?]({Link})**  \\n[\u2b50]({Link})  \\n[\u2b50\u2b50]({Link})  \\n[\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50]({Link})  \\n  \\nTo make sure you keep getting these emails, please add _chris@finxter.com_ to\\nyour address book.  \\n  \\nI\\'d love to hear your feedback so that I can improve this free email course\\nover time.
